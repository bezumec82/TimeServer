Configuration must be done in file 'LaOSconfig.h'. 
All explanations look inside.

The base usage pattern is demonstrated in file 'main.cpp'.
The idea is simple - show your thread functions to
the core and it will cycle it for you.
Don't forget to call 'Yeild', when the job is done.

At the present moment solemn usage of OS 
is to link it in your eclipse-based project.
Just drug folder LaOS inside your project 
and add 'LaOS/Inc' in 'Includes' :
Properties -> C/C++ General -> Path and Symbols -> Includes

To successfully compile your project, folder 'LaOS/support' 
should be removed from sources. Add a filter:
Properties -> C/C++ General -> Path and Symbols -> Source Location

Inside folder '/support' provided fixed linker script
and '..start.s' files. The main idea behind it to keep code in FLASH,
and execute it from SRAM. Such an arrangement makes it possible to 
organize the hot re-flash of MCU.
In the present moment, only STM32H575 is supported.

Core of OS is realized as signleton pattern,
as far as you include it in your project - you have it.

If you use STMCubeMX :
 -  disable code generation for 'MemManage_Handler'
    and 'SVC_Handler'

STM32 HAL uses global structures to access peripheral - 
to make these structures accessible add macro 'REMOVE_PROTECTION'
before the definition.

File 'sysmem.c' should be removed. File 'sysmem.cpp' its substitute.
